# COMFORTZONE-SALES-DATA

### **PROJECT SUMMARY:**
____________
**COMFORTZONE SALES DATA** project aims to perform a detailed exploration of sales data to provide actionable insights into product performance, regional sales, and monthly sales trends. The ultimate goal is to create an interactive Power BI dashboard that allows managements and stakeholders to quickly and easily visualize key sales insights.

### **PROJECT OVERVIEW:**
________________
**COMFORTZONE SALES DATA** want to boost its sales but is having trouble figuring out what's really driving their performance. With a lot of sales data coming from different regions and products, it's tough to see whcih items are the best sellers, how each area us doing, and how sales change month to month. 

So the goes of this project is to look more into this data to find more clear insights. By doing so, I will create a Power BI Visualization so as to know what's wortking and what's not working. So am helping COMFORTZONE make smarter decision to increase sales and better serve their customers.
